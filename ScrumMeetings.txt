Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous meeting, we discussed basic webpage design for our application and implementation for the design elements. This included building upon previous receipt and Wireframe designs for our web pages and more clearly defining what designs we wanted to display. In terms of the future, we discussed how we plan on providing security for manager view, as we want to be able to redirect users who have not logged in away from the cashier/manager page based on their sign-in, how the frontend would change based on profile login, database generation changes, and technical discussion of how we would implement Gets and Puts in the backend.
